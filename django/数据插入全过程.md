## 两种方法往数据库插入数据（本质上是create object）
1.编写classmethod
2.直接删除

## 遇到的问题：`<a>`标签向后台post数据
解决办法：！！！模仿calculator 通过url向后台传参数

## 中途修改model（更改数据库模型）
Working with migrations is simple. Make changes to your models - say, add a field and remove a model - and then run makemigrations:
```
$ python manage.py makemigrations
Migrations for 'books':
  books/migrations/0003_auto.py:
    - Alter field author on book
```
Your models will be scanned and compared to the versions currently contained in your migration files, and then a new set of migrations will be written out. Make sure to read the output to see what makemigrations thinks you have changed - it’s not perfect, and for complex changes it might not be detecting what you expect.

Once you have your new migration files, you should apply them to your database to make sure they work as expected:
```
$ python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: books
Running migrations:
  Rendering model states... DONE
  Applying books.0003_auto... OK
```
